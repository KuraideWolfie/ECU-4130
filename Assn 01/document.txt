This is a singular document text file that is made available with the first programming assignment. It contains a series of words and other text that the program will process, generating a series of grams and word frequencies for. The assignment was made in Spring of 2018, and was a singular file project, requiring a revision later on after the discovery of a bug that caused issues regarding file redirection for data processing.
