Description: <br/>
_(The programming language used in this course was at the discretion of the student. As long as the program could be run on the instructor’s end, any language was selectable, such as Java or Python.)_ Information Retrieval, taught by Dr. Venkat Gudivada, introduced us to the concepts of tokenization, indexing, and retrieval of relevant documents in a textual corpus – that is, a collection of text documents. Terminology such as unigram, bigram, and trigram appeared alongside tokenization, accuracy, and precision, with vector space models and inverted indices explored atop other retrieval concepts and techniques.<br/>
